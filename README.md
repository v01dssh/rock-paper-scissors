Problem solving 
1. Understand the problem 

2. Create a plan on how you will approach solving the problem and -consider writing pseudocode- / plan the parts your app will have before hand, is it going to have a UI, How will you input the data to the program, what output are you expecting, and most importantly

How are you going to go about writing the algorithm that will take your input and give you the desired output!

3. Divide the problem into sub-problems / or the program into sub programs or scripts. (Divide and conquer)

4. Debug, Refactor, Improve the code, add features, clean your code and make it run more efficently 

These steps are all what you need to create anything in programming. 


### For Rock paper scissors: 

1. The task at hand involves taking input from the player of either (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), generating a random number, creating a list of possible outcomes (same as the input), then randomly indexing one of the list items based on the random number, then we create a function that takes the two inputs (Player choice, Computer Choice) and then decide who's the winner based on an algorithm we write, later on we create a game loop of 5 turns, saving whos the winner on each turn, and using a while loop to do so, at the end we console.log() the winner. after we are done with the main app functionality it is time for UI, I will draw a design on Figma -Remember to learn that later- and implement the basic design in HTML and CSS, then I will learn how to use the DOM to take players press on an image of either a rock or paper or scissor and assign that value as (Player Choice) and update the DOM by tracking the player and computer score, and then popping up a screen that tells your you win or you lose, consider adding sound and animation later on to make it more exciting, and then share the game online. 

2. The plan is as follows: 
    a. Take player Input and save it to a variable called playerChoice 
    b. Create a function that generate a random number, create a list of the computer choices, and then return a random choice.
    c. Create a function that serves as your main app logic for determinating who is the winner (The Algorithm), return who is the winner.
    d. Create a game loop where there is 5 turns to play, create a loop counter, a player wins counter , and a computer wins counter. then Console.log the winner when the loop ends. 
    e. Create a design in Figma for the website, download assets, and implement the design in HTML and CSS, then Hook up the images to the player choice, update the player wins, computer wins dom elements with the actual variables, and then create a popup with you win or lose. 
    
3. I think I divided my task as above more than enough. 

4. This is the last part where I will find a way to add sound and animation, and perhaps add time-breaks where I add an animation that shows a picture of both your choice and the computer choice clashing together, which would be nice.
