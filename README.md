Problem solving 

1. Understand the problem 

2. Create a plan on how you will approach solving the problem + pseudocode
plan the parts your app will have before hand, is it going to have a UI, 
How will you input the data to the program, what output are you expecting, and most importantly
How are you going to go about writing the algorithm that will take your input and give you the desired output!

3. Divide the problem into sub-problems / or the program into sub programs or scripts. (Divide and conquer)

4. Debug, Refactor, Improve the code, add features, clean code.
